Bike to Work Visualization
--------------------------

This is a little silly program to get the May bike to work month data from Cascade's website, and format it in a fun and interesting way. You can compare riders by total miles and by commute rate. I'm sure there is a much better way to structure all of this code, but it's up and working, and was made very quickly.
